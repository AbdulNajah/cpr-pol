# Test 1



According to senior government officials, the framework may also be expanded to cover non-news television channels, as well as films and series streamed on OTT platforms.

There are currently no legislative provisions governing online news or video streaming platforms. For TV news channels, self-regulation or industry oversight is largely the case, although the government can take action under the Cable TV Act for violations of the Programme and Advertising Code.

The officials described the government’s plans as “fluid” at this stage, but noted that they had received several complaints about “fake news” on digital news platforms, and the content streamed on OTT platforms.

The Ministry of Information & Broadcasting is currently preparing to issue guidelines for content streamed on OTT platforms, but officials said the eventual plan is to have a separate legislative framework for online and electronic media. It is not clear yet if the proposed legislation will cover radio too.

“The details are being discussed at present and this would be the way forward, subject to approvals from all levels,” a senior government official said.
