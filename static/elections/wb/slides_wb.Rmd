- West Bengal represents a new wave of religious polarisation in the country.

- Not the typical divide that has dominant caste Hindu angst at its centre, but rather lower caste Hindus.

 - All cultural anxieties, political contentions, and economic angle.

- Why social identities spilling into the political realm?

- Subaltern Hindutva. differences in causes and consequences: cultural anxieties, political contentions, and economic angle.

- This election will leave a scar on nature of the social fracture in Bengal politics for a long-time.
