## Major theories of voting behaviour 


- Sociological Model: Identified with the Columbia school - focuses on influence of social factors like group affiliation (**The People’s Choice; Personal Influence**).

- Psychosocial Model: Identified with the Michigan school - focuses on effect of partisanship or party identification (**The American Voter**).

- Rational Choice Model: Identified with the work by Anthony Downs (**An Economic Theory of Democracy**) and argues that voters seek to maximise the utility of their vote and parties seek to maximise electoral gains.

## Major theories and framework  


###  Preferences and Political accountability

- Ideology

    - Spatial model/Downsian model - preference based on ideological proximities between parties and voters.
    
    - Median voter theorem .
    
    - Ideology & Identity : Statism & Recognition -  Chhibber and Verma 
    
- Partisanship

    - People identify with certain parties and their loyalty stays intact despite political circumstances. 
    
    - Partisan  Heart and Minds - Green, Palmquist & Schickler
    
- Personalistic voting

- Ethnicity, caste, religion

    - In-group favoritism.
   
    - Ethnic voting - Chandra
  
    - Co-religiosity and voting behaviour : Heath et al.
  
---


- Programmatic outreach: voters reward performance on civic/economic and developmental issues.

    - Improving public goods: evidence from limited experiments across states
    
    - Public provisioning of private, tangible goods 
    
- Clientelism/Patronage Politics: Quid pro quo - Political parties earn support by the distribution of public or private goods to targeted groups of voters 

    - Kanchan Chandra - India as a patronage democracy -> ethnic favouritism .
    
    - Brokers and Dallas
    
      - Naya Neta's - Anirudh Krishna
    
      - You can’t buy a vote : Meanings of money in a Mumbai election- Bjorkman
    
      - Electoral Handouts in Mumbai Elections -: Cost of electoral competition - Chauchard



# Studying voting behaviour using surveys

<!-- Surveys as tools for studying voting behaviour -->
---

- **Why use surveys? **

    - Is there utility beyond poll predictions? Use in academia, policy-making
    
    - Extensive thematic spread 
    
    - Consistency of questions gives temporal comparability 


- **Kinds of surveys **

  - Pre, Post and Exit 

- Clarifies issues salient to making voting decisions - short term and long term factors.

- Snapshot of group behaviour at macro level - group affiliation, groupthink, partisan sorting .
 


---

## National Election Studies 

- Conducted by the Lokniti-Centre for the Study of Developing Societies , NES are a series of nationally representative surveys conducted during before and after Lok Sabha elections.

- Consistent data on electoral choices available from 1996 onwards.

- High quality data gathered through a network of state representatives.

- Emphasis on random sampling, representativeness and vote integrity (through hidden ballot).

## National Election Studies 

**Studying voting behaviour involves going beyond the question of who people vote for. Major themes in the questionnaire :**

- Issue based voting 
- Current events 
- Public opinion on institutions  
- Welfare scheme benefits and credit attribution 
- Ideological and identity related questions 
- Religiosity related questions 
- Political participation
- Voting choice and partisan affiliation
- Leadership effect 
- Demographic details 
- Media exposure 



---


- **Limitations of survey research : **

  - Biases associated with questionnaire design, sampling 
  
  - Sacrifice depth for scale 
  
  - Difficult to maintain comparability across waves 
  
  - Expensive 
  
  - Data crunching not a short-cut for in depth research! 
  
- **What does the future hold? **

  - Prohibitive costs reducing/technological changes, allows for greater frequency of large scale surveys 
  
  - Survey experiments
  
  - Longitudinal panel-based studies to understand nuanced changes in opinions

## Why is it difficult to study Indian voters ?

  
- Conceptual limitations: diverse country, post-colonial experiment, nascent democracy

- Data paucity: lack of longitudinal data, methodological concerns 

- False binary of methods : conversation between disciplines needs to move beyond simple criticism and towards greater synthesis and rigour 

- Lack of trained data researchers 

- Lack of open data access

## Way forward for electoral studies in India 



- Fill gaps in the data: Increasing ease of doing surveys allows for more data

- Indian voters not a mysterious entity! Possible to develop epistemology of Indian voters.

- Silent voters, swing voters, fluctuations, volatility - concepts developed elsewhere are even valid for the Indian context; only needs careful examination.

- Increasing media exposure, political churn and demographic changes is already producing a new Indian voter and novel political engagements.
